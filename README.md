🎓 Semester Project Highlight – MEDEASE: Medical Center Management System 🩺💻



I'm thrilled to present MEDEASE, a comprehensive standalone desktop application that I developed as my first semester final project at campus. This project was a deep dive into full-stack desktop application development, system design, real-world problem-solving, and practical application of software engineering principles.



🏥 About MEDEASE

MEDEASE is designed specifically to manage the complete operations of a medical center serving outpatients only. It features an in-house pharmacy, and the entire system is tailored with role-based access to ensure streamlined workflows for each type of employee.



🔐 Role-Based Dashboards & Core Features

👩‍💼 Manager Dashboard

View daily summaries of appointments, income, and profit



Manage employees (add, update, delete)



Mark attendance and manage salaries (salary auto-calculated based on attendance)



Handle inventory and supplier management



Approve stock requests from nurses



Trigger automated stock request emails to specific suppliers based on medicine type



🧑‍⚕️ Doctor Dashboard

View all appointments scheduled for the day



Prescribe medications, triggering the automatic generation of a digital prescription



Max of 60 appointments per day



After every 10 patients checked out, an email notification is sent to the next batch of patients



💼 Receptionist Dashboard

Register new patients and manage patient records



Schedule and manage appointments



Handle payment processing, which triggers bill generation



👩‍🔬 Nurse Dashboard

Manage the in-house pharmacy



Issue prescribed medications



Request stock for low inventory items (requests sent to the Manager dashboard)



💡 Technical Stack & Architecture

Language & UI: Java, JavaFX, CSS



Database: MySQL



Architecture: MVC using Maven project structure



Report Generation: JasperReports (for dynamic bills and prescriptions)



Emailing System: Integrated using the SuMail API (automated notifications & supplier communications)



📈 What I Learned

Implementing a modular, real-world system with proper separation of concerns



Hands-on experience with desktop UI/UX design using JavaFX



Managing data persistence and SQL optimization



Using external APIs for email services



Report designing and printing with JasperReports



Real-world scenarios like appointment limits, attendance-based salaries, and stock tracking



💬 This project helped me grow immensely as a software engineering student and gave me a solid foundation in building professional desktop applications. Excited to keep learning and building smarter solutions!
